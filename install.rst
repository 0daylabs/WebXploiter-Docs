Installation
============

Prerequisites
-------------

There are a few packages which are necessary before proceeding with the installation:

    * Git client: ``sudo apt-get install git``
    * Python 2.7, which is installed by default in most systems
    * Python pip: ``sudo apt-get install python-pip``

Supported Distros
-----------------

As of now, only Debian - Ubuntu variants (apt-get) are supported. We will soon update it to support other distributions.

Install
-------

Installation is as easy as cloning the github repo and running the install script:

.. code-block:: bash

    git clone https://github.com/team-bi0s/WebXploiter.git
